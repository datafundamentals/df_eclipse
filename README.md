# df_eclipse-cookbook

This cookbook installs the eclipse IDE on a vagrant instance for a Development environment

## Supported Platforms

Ubuntu: 12.04. this is the only one that has been created for us that is usable as a desktop mode, so this is now our dev environment. 

## Attributes



## Usage
This is for a Ubuntu desktop environment only. It is not designed to be faster or fancier than that at this point in time 

### df_eclipse::default

As of version 0.1.1, this is designed to work as a standalone cookbook. This in the long run will require you to use roles or a role cookbook for proper installation, but I think that you can forgive me for now if I am lazy
